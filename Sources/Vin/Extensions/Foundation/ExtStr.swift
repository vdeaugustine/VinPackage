    /**
      A computed property that transforms a `String` into a bold version of itself.

      It uses a mapping from standard ASCII characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) to the corresponding bold
      Unicode characters, iterating through each character in the original `String` and converting
      it to its bold counterpart when possible.

      If a character doesn't have a corresponding bold version in the mapping (such as special characters or whitespace),
      it's appended to the resulting `String` without transformation.

      ## Example Usage:
      ```swift
      let myString = "Hello, world!"
      print(myString.asBold)
      // Prints: "ððð¥ð¥ð¨, ð°ð¨ð«ð¥ð!" instead of "Hello, world!"
      ```

      ## Note:
      The property can't make non-alphabetic or non-numeric characters bold, as they don't have corresponding Unicode equivalents.

      - Returns: The string with all alphanumeric characters replaced by their bold Unicode counterparts.
